Simple script I made to spam SnK streams at https://vaughn.live/
The site had a pesky anti-bot system, but script takes care of that as well. 

Before you run it, make sure to add a chromedriver.exe (matching your chrome version) to the script folder. You also need to replace the cdc_ string inside the driver: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33225947/can-a-website-detect-when-you-are-using-selenium-with-chromedriver/52108199#52108199
